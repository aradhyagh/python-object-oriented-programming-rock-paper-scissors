# ðŸŽ® Object-Oriented Python Game rock paper scissors

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project is a Python-based game implemented using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. The code includes:  
- A **playable game loop**  
- A **scoreboard system** to track progress  
- An **exit option** to end the game gracefully

## ðŸ›  Features  
âœ… Fully structured using **OOP concepts** (classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism)  
âœ… A **scoreboard** that updates dynamically  
âœ… **Exit functionality** for a smooth user experience  
âœ… Modular and clean **Python code**  

## ðŸ“Œ How to Play  
1. **Start the game** â€“ Run `game.py` to begin.  
2. **Keep track of your score** â€“ Points are recorded dynamically.  
3. **Exit anytime** â€“ Use the built-in exit option to quit safely.
